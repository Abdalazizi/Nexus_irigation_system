# Nexus irrigation system

## Overview
This project is a **Nexus irrigation system** that helps farmers manage their crops, irrigation system, and get weather updates. The system includes features like user registration, crop management, irrigation control, and weather information.

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**: 
   - Farmers can register as new users or log in to an existing account to access the dashboard.
   
2. **Crop Management**:
   - Farmers can register new crops by entering the crop name, type, and area.
   - They can also view all crops they've registered.
   
3. **Irrigation Control**:
   - Farmers can turn the irrigation system on or off.
   - They can also set the irrigation duration and decide whether it should turn off automatically after a certain period.

4. **Weather Information**:
   - The system generates a random weather report showing the weather condition, temperature, and humidity.
