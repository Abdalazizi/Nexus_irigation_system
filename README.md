Nexus Irrigation System
About
The Nexus Irrigation System provides a weather information tool designed to assist farmers in making critical decisions based on weather conditions, temperature, and humidity. This system is part of a larger effort to enhance farming practices, particularly in irrigation.

Features
Simulated Weather Conditions: Provides random weather conditions like Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, and more.

Temperature & Humidity: Randomized values for temperature (15°C to 35°C) and humidity (40% to 90%) based on real-world farming scenarios.

User-Friendly Interface: Interactive prompt for weather updates that help farmers make informed decisions about irrigation, planting, and harvesting.

How It Works
When the script runs, it will ask if you want to check the weather.

Type "yes" to view simulated weather information, or "no" to exit the system.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Abdalazizi/Nexus_irigation_system.git
cd Nexus_irigation_system
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x weather_display.py
Run the weather information script:

bash
Copy code
./weather_display.py
Example Output
bash
Copy code
Do you want to check the weather? (yes/no): yes

--- Weather Information ---
Condition: Sunny
Temperature: 28°C
Humidity: 60%

Why This Project?
This simple tool helps farmers stay informed about weather conditions without relying on external sources. By simulating weather data, the Nexus Irrigation System enables farmers to make more informed decisions about irrigation, planting, and harvesting, improving overall productivity.

Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time weather data via an API.

Add more farming features, such as soil moisture monitoring.
